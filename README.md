## üëã Introduction

This is the place for Stencila's visual design resources (e.g. CSS, icons,
logos), styles and Web Components. The resources here are reused across a number of
other repositories including our main [`website`](https://github.com/stencila/website), the
[`hub`](https://github.com/stencila/hub), and [`thema`](https://github.com/stencila/thema).

We aim to maintain browser support parity with React, namely popular browsers
according to CanIUse, including IE9 and above.

## üì¶ Packages

This repository is a [monorepo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monorepo), and contains the following packages:

- [components](./packages/components): Web Components built using [StencilJS](https://stenciljs.com), styled using the `style-*` packages listed below.
- [style-stencila](./packages/style-stencila): CSS for styling semantic HTML markup in Stencila's own visual language.
- [style-material](./packages/style-material): CSS for styling semantic HTML markup in Google's Material Design visual language.
- [brand](./packages/brand): Stencila branding elements such as fonts, logos, and illustrations.

## üìú Documentation

See the [guide](./packages/components) for getting started with integrating our Web Components into your site. Then, more detailed, interactive documentation for each component is available at https://stencila.github.io/designa/. For example, see the docs on the [code editor](https://stencila.github.io/designa/?path=/docs/atoms-editor-) and executable [code chunk](https://stencila.github.io/designa/?path=/docs/schema-nodes-code-chunk) components.

## üõ† Development

To get started with development, clone this repo:

`git clone git@github.com:stencila/designa.git`

Then install the necessary Node packages:

`npm install && npm run bootstrap`

Start Storybook and watch for changes inside `/packages/*`

`npm run dev`

> üò© Note that you will currently have to manually reload, or disable/enable the desired "CSS Resource" in Storybook after making changes to see the results. A fix for this is high on the priority list.

### Adding Components

Create a [new Storybook story](https://storybook.js.org/docs/basics/writing-stories/)
and avoid using CSS classes as much as possible. Use semantic HTML tags and WAI-ARIA
attributes instead. See the [External Resources](#External-Resources) section
below for useful references.

Once the story is written, you will need to add appropriate styles for each design system.
Currently we support:

- [Stencila's own design system](./packages/style-stencila)
- [Material Design system](./packages/style-stencila)

### Commit Messages

Please use [conventional
changelog](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/conventional-changelog)
style commit messages e.g. `docs(readme): fixed spelling mistake`.
[`semantic-release`](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release) is
enabled to automate version management: minor version releases are done if
any `feat(...)` commits are pushed, patch version releases are done if any
`fix(...)` commits are pushed. See [the
specifications](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0-beta.2/) for
full details.

Package builds and Storybook generation are done on [Travis
CI](https://travis-ci.org/stencila/designa). Releases are made to the sub-packages
found inside the packages directory.
